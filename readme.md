# WIP Dataflight

Personal project to collect and monitor as much price data across multiple airlines as possible. This collection of scripts powers https://viatic.cheap/

### Dependencies

Uses my version of ryanair-py https://github.com/victorbmlabs/RyanAir-Python.
This adds some tweaks and common methods on classes to help abstract code. 
If you want to use, I highly suggest forking it and making changes for yourself. It's only a couple of modules!
